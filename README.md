# SauceLabsAPICaller

SauceLabsAPICaller.ipa is ready to run on any RDC device running at least iOS 15. It's a pretty simple project that runs through an array os apis and calles each one. The resulting har file can be imported for API testing.

Adding a url can be done in the callAllAPIS function in the APICaller class. New urls will require re export of the app.
